'''
We have a list of three strings defined in the code area.

Extend the code so your program prints out the following out of that list:

0-Document.txt
1-Report.txt
2-Presentation.txt
'''

filenames = ['document', 'report', 'presentation']

for index , item in enumerate(filenames):
    row = f"{index}-{item}.txt"
    print(row)
